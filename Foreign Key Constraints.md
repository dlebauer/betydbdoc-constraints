# Foreign Key Constraints

All foreign key constraints follow the form `table_id references tables`, following Ruby style conventions. 

A [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/dlebauer/12d8d9ed1b2965301d64) contains a list of foreign key constraints to be placed on BETYdb. The foreign keys are named using the form `fk_foreigntable_lookuptable_1` where the foreigntable has the foreign key.
